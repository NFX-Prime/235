        Hello! My name is Filiberto Nieves IV! I am a Game Design and Development Major at RIT and I am currently in my 2nd year of education.
        I have had a lot of interests over the years, but some that stuck with me were the following:
    </p>

    <ul class="bulletlist">
        <li>Playing Video Games</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Exercising</li>
        <li>Watching Shows</li>
        <li>Puzzles</li>
        <li>Listening To Podcasts</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="descriptions">
        Some of the things that I hope to get out of this class are the ability to create visually appealing and functional websites, as well as some experience in 
        different coding languages, such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        During my time at RIT, I had a lot of time to think about my major, and I also had a lot of time to experience what my major would have in store for me once
        I started in the field for real. With my Game Design and Development degree, I wish to be a game designer at a company like <em>FromSoftware</em>, which is infamous
        for making some of the most story-driven and difficult games out there, such as the <em>Dark Souls</em> series, and other works like <em>Bloodborne</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. 
        Realistically though, I would be happy if I was able to be a game designer at all, due to the competition of the job market of the field.
    </p>
