                The purpose of this document is to make a small website about a very popular indie game called <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, a game about a robot
                fighting through the layers of hell to eliminate everything inside of it. I found this game to also be very fun, which is why I decided to make
                my project about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The audience of this document are the people (like me) who enjoy playing the game <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, as well as others who may be interested
                in the premise of the game and its mechanics. With that in mind, I wanted the information to be quite organized (unlike the game itself) to give
                a comprehensive view of the story of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> and some reasons why I personally enjoyed it.
