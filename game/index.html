    <p>
        <em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.<br>
        Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase you around.<br>
       The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to <strong>inflate the monsters to the point where they explode.</strong> [...]<br>
