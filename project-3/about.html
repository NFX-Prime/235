    <h1>Soda Popper!</h1>
<div>
    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>Soda Popper is a game that is similar to <a href="https://classicreload.com/tapper.html#">Root Beer Tapper</a>, a game where you play as a bartender
    serving drinks to customers.<br> For my concept, I would like to attempt to recreate Tapper, but you play as a waiter serving soda cans to a busy college party.</p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>The genre of the game is considered action by Wikipedia, since it revolves around tossing soda at college kids</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>The game will be desktop only</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The main story of Soda Popper:<br><br>
    You will be playing as a waiter who got scheduled for the busiest night at their workplace. Today is the big game, and lots of college students are coming<br>
    to get some grub, and a nice bottle of pop to sip on.<br> <br>
    The main motivation of the player should be giving soda cans to the customers that are in the line!
    </p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>Since it's based on Tapper, I was planning on using pixel art graphics with an 8-bit sound design. The types of sounds the player should hear are<br>
    background music, maybe happy dings if they successfully serve a customer / collect cash, and a dissatisfying noise if they miss a customer.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <p>Some of the main mechanics that the game has are the following:<br><br>
    Moving up and down a set of lines of customers, tossing soda cans down the lines to customers, walking down the line to collect cash</p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>W and S: Move up/down the lines</li>
        <li>A: Move into the line</li>
        <li>M1: Toss soda cans into the line</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Onboarding</h3>
    <p> There will be small tips on the start menu to tell the player how they can move and serve customers</p>
    <h3>Player Learning</h3>
    <p>The player needs to learn how to properly manage their position so they can successfully serve the customers.<br>
    They will also learn to manage how many sodas they throw at once, because if they throw too many, they will miss the customers and lose a life.</p>

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Filiberto Nieves IV, I am a second year at RIT and I am majoring in Game Design and Development! I have experience in 3D Modeling, Programming, and Graphic Design.<br>
    I've used coding languages like C#, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I have also used programs such as Maya, Unity, and Photoshop. I have also delved into frameworks like Monogame and PIXI.js for
    various different projects, including this one that you will see.</p>

    <h1>Project Plan!</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Starting Off!</h2>
        <h3>12/4</h3>
        <p>
            
            Starting with some of the assets I created:<br>
            <img src="images/patron_placeholder.png" alt="patron placeholder">
            <img src="images/soda-Big.png" alt="bigger soda">
            <img src="images/barStools.png" alt="barstools">   
            <img src="images/waiter_placeholder.png" alt="waiter placeholder">
            <img src="images/soda.png" alt="small soda">
            
            <br><br>
            Some of these are placeholders at the moment, so I will be using them sparingly until I get the logic correct and sound.<br>
            I think some of them are here to stay though (soda).<br>
            I have also completed some of the logic surrounding the different game states, as well as a temporary title/game menu.

        </p>

        <h2>Completion!</h2>
        <h3>12/15</h3>
        <p>
            I didn't include every single day that I was working on the project (mainly because I forgot to document it), but I've been<br>
            working very hard on figuring out some things!<br>
            Firstly, I created some new assets for the different people, items, and overall environment!<br><br>
            <img src="images/floor.png" alt="Wooden floor">
            <img src="images/wall.png" alt="Wooden wall">
            <img src="images/sodaTipped.png" alt="Tipped over soda">
            <img src="images/waiter.png" alt="actual waiter sprite">   
            <img src="images/patron.png" alt="actual patron sprite">
            <img src="images/football.png" alt="small football field">
            <img src="images/money.png" alt="money sprite">
            <br><br>
            These are in no particular order, but I made all of them myself! :)<br><br>
            What I didn't make myself were the sounds I added, so I will be putting all of those here!
