    <h1>Soda Popper!</h1>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>Soda Popper is a game that is similar to <a href="https://classicreload.com/tapper.html#">Root Beer Tapper</a>, a game where you play as a bartender
    serving drinks to customers.<br> For my concept, I would like to attempt to recreate Tapper, but you play as a waiter serving soda pop to a busy college party.</p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>The genre of the game is considered action by Wikipedia, since it revolves around tossing soda at college kids</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>The game will be desktop only</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The main story of Soda Popper:<br><br>
    You will be playing as a waiter who got scheduled for the busiest night at their workplace. Today is the big game, and lots of college students are coming<br>
    to get some grub, and a nice bottle of pop to sip on.<br> <br>
    The main motivation of the player should be giving soda pops to the customers that are in the line, and collecting their empty bottles before they hit the ground.
    </p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>Since it's based on Tapper, I was planning on using pixel art graphics with an 8-bit sound design. The types of sounds the player should hear are<br>
    background music, maybe happy dings if they successfully serve a customer, and glass shattering if they miss a customer/don't collect the leftover glass.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <p>Some of the main mechanics that the game has are the following:<br><br>
    Moving up and down a set of lines of customers, tossing soda bottles down the lines to customers, walking down the line to collect empty bottles</p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Up Arrow/W and Down Arrow/S: Move up/down the lines</li>
        <li>Left Arrow/A: Move into the line</li>
        <li>Spacebar: Toss soda bottles into the line</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Onboarding</h3>
    <p>After pressing start, the player will be shown a black screen listing the controls of the game and an indication to press space to start<br>
        Players will be given a small menu in the top left of the screen to remember the controls after the screen</p>
    <h3>Player Learning</h3>
