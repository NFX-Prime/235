    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>

        <em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.<br>
        Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase you around.<br>
       The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to <strong>inflate the monsters to the point where they explode.</strong> [...]<br>

    <h2>Quote</h2>

        <p> definitely goes under the heading of <strong>"Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs,"</strong>
             or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.<br>
